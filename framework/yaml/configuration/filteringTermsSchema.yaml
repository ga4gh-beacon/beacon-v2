      ftType:
        description: Type of filter term, according to the 'request/filteringTerms.json'
          schema. * 'ontologyTerm' is a term that belongs to a tree of concepts, hence
          suitable to operations like 'query by similarity' or 'include all descendants'.
          Many ontology terms are a value in itself (like 'female'), hence no further
          information is required to solve the query. * 'alphanumeric' is a field
          or an ontology term (like 'age') that requires a value to complete the intended
          query. Only attributes of known schemas SHOULD be used here. For attributes
          that are not part of the known schemas, the 'custom' type MUST be used.
          * 'custom' is anything that doesn't fit the previous categories and mainly
          for custom dictionaries that have no ontology nor a corresponding attribute
          in the known schemas. Usually only makes sense for close partners that are
          familiar with the custom dictionary.
