    "description": "A `beaconResultsetsResponse` returns the results of a query against a beacon or beacon aggregator. Beyond the `responseSummary` for overall matches the response contains details about the matches in individual **collections** in the beacon or beacon network. This type of response is required when serving a request with a \"record\" level `responseGranularity`, and `beaconResultsets` typically contain a list of records matched by the query.\nThe types of `beaconResultsets` objects are defined in the beacon's configuration; e.g. if using the Beacon v2+ default model the types `dataset` and `cohort` are supported as result sets.
