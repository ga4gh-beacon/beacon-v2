Many ontology terms are a value in itself (like 'female'), hence no further information is required to solve the query. * 'alphanumeric' is a field or an ontology term (like 'age') that requires a value to complete the intended query. Only attributes of known schemas SHOULD be used here. For attributes that are not part of the known schemas, the 'custom' type MUST be used. * 'custom' is anything that doesn't fit the previous categories and mainly for custom dictionaries that have no ontology nor a corresponding attribute in the known schemas. Usually only makes sense for close partners that are familiar with the custom dictionary.",
