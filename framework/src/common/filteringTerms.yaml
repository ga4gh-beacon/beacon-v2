title: Filtering Term Element
description: >-
  Filtering terms are the main means to select subsets of records from a Beacon
  response. While the name implies the application to a generated response, in
  practice implementations may apply them at the query stage.
  Note: In the processing of Beacon v2.0 requests multiple filters are assumed
  to be chained by the logical AND operator.

        default: exact
        description: Allow the Beacon to return results which do not match the filter
          exactly, but do match to a certain degree of similarity. The Beacon defines
          the semantic similarity model implemented and how to apply the thresholds
          of 'high', 'medium' and 'low' similarity.

      fields.
