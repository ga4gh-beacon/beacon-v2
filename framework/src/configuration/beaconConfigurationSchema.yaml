  securityAttributes:
    description: Configuration of the security aspects of the Beacon. By default,
      a Beacon that does not declare the configuration settings would return `boolean`
      (true/false) responses, and only if the user is authenticated and explicitly
      authorized to access the Beacon resources. Although this is the safest set of
      settings, it is not recommended unless the Beacon shares very sensitive information.
      Non sensitive Beacons should preferably opt for a `record` and `PUBLIC` combination.
