description: "Definition of an element or entry type including the Beacon v2 required\
  \ and suggested attributes. This schema purpose is to  describe each type of entities\
  \ included in a Beacon, hence Beacon clients could have some metadata about such\
  \ entities.\n\nThe `id` attribute is the key that should be used in other parts\
  \ of the Beacon Model to allow Beacon clients to identify the different parts (e.g.\
  \ endpoints, filteringTerms, request parameters, etc.) that fully describe an entry\
  \ type."

  But that configuration fails to validate. Further investigation is required, but
  should not affect the resulting schema.'

      is a collection of Records), then this attribute must list the entry types that
      could be included. One collection type could be defined as included more than
      one entry type (e.g. a Dataset could include Individuals or Genomic Variants),
      in such cases the entries are alternative, meaning that a given instance of
      this entry type could be of only one of the types (e.g. a given Dataset contains
      Individuals, while another Dataset could contain Genomic Variants, but not both
      at once).
