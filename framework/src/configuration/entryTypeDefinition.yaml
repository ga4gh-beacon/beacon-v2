  Definition of an element or entity, to describe each type of entity included in
  a beacon.
  The `id` attribute is the key that should be used in other parts of the data model
  to allow Beacon clients to identify the different parts (e.g. endpoints, filteringTerms,
  request parameters, etc.) that relvant for an entity.

    description: >-
      If the entry type is a collection of other entities, (e.g. a Dataset
      is a collection of Records), then this attribute must list the entities that
      can be included. One _collection_ can include more than one entity 
      (e.g. a Dataset in teh Beacon cdefault model could include Individuals, Biosamples,
      GenomicVariations, Analyses amnd Runs). In such cases in each individual
      response (e.g. `resultSetsResponse` of collections of type "dataset") will
      contain entries of a single entity type (e.g. biosamples) even if a dataset
      may contain records of multiple types.

      TO DO: Evaluate switch this to `url` or a more specific way for allowing
      URLs and local file paths (is this necessary?).
