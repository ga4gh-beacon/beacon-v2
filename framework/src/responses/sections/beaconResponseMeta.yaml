  returnedSchemas:
    description: >-
      The `returnedSchemas` parameter indicates that the request has been interpreted
      for the indicated entity. This helps to disambiguate between negative responses
      due to e.g. no hit on a well understood request and failures to interpret or
      answer the request due to a missing entity.
