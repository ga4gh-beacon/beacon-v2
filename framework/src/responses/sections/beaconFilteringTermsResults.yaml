        type: string
        description: >-
          Either "custom", "alphanumeric" or ontology/terminology full name.
          TODO: An ontology ... with a registered prefix does not need a full name
          so one may better use CURIE to indicate that the resource can be retrieved
          from the id. This also will allow to provide an enum here.
        examples: 
          - "Human Phenotype Ontology"
          - alphanumeric
      id:
        description: >-
          The field id in the case of numeric or alphanumeric fields, or
          the term id in the case of ontology or custom terms. CURIE syntax in the
          case of an ontology term.
        type: string
        examples:
          - 'NCIT:C8936'
          - HP:0008773
      label:
        description: >-
          This would be the "preferred Label" in the case of an ontology term.
        type: string
        examples:
          - 'B Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma'
