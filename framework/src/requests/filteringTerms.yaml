title: Filtering Term Element
description: >-
  Filtering terms are the main means to select subsets of records from a Beacon
  response. While the name implies the application to a generated response, in
  practice implementations may apply them at the query stage.
  Note: In the processing of Beacon v2.0 requests multiple filters are assumed
  to be chained by the logical AND operator.
