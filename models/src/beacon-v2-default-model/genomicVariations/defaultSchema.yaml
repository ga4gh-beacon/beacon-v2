    description: >-
      Reference to the **internal** variant ID. This represents the primary
      key/identifier of that variant **inside** a given Beacon instance. Different
      Beacon instances may use identical id values, referring to unrelated variants.
      Public identifiers such as the GA4GH Variant Representation Id (VRSid) MUST
      be returned in the `identifiers` section. A Beacon instance can, of course,
      use the VRSid as their own internal id but still MUST represent this then in
      the `identifiers` section.

      variantType:
        description: >-
          The `variantType` declares the nature of the variation in relation
          to a reference. In a response, it is used to describe the variation. In
          a request, it is used to declare the type of event the Beacon client is
          looking for. If in queries variants can not be defined through a sequence
          of one or more bases (`precise` variants) it can be used standalone (i.e.
          without `alternateBases`) together with positional parameters. Examples
          here are e.g. queries for structural variants such as `DUP` (increased allelic
          count of material from the genomic region  between `start` and `end` positions
          without assumption about the placement of the additional sequence) or `DEL`
          (deletion of sequence following `start`). Either `alternateBases` or `variantType`
          is required, with the exception of range queries (single `start` and `end`
          parameters).
        type: string
        examples:
          - SNP
          - DEL

          Reference bases for this variant (starting from `start`).
          * Accepted values: IUPAC codes for nucleotides (e.g. `https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html`).
          * N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of any base, and can be used
            as a standalone base of any type or within a partially known sequence. As
            example, a query of `ANNT` the Ns can take take any form of `[ACGT]` and
            will match `ANNT`, `ACNT`, `ACCT`, `ACGT` ... and so forth.
          * an *empty value* is used in the case of insertions with the maximally
            trimmed, inserted sequence being indicated in `AlternateBases`.
          NOTE: Beacon instances may not support UIPAC codes and it is not mandatory
          for them to do so. In such cases the use of [ACGTN] is mandated.

          * Categorical variant queries, e.g. such *not* being represented through
            sequence & position, make use of the `variantType` parameter.
          * Either `alternateBases` or `variantType` is required.'
