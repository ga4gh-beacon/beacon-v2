  cohortType:
    description: >-
      Cohort type by its definition. If a cohort is declared `study-defined`
      or `beacon-defined` criteria are to be entered `in cohort_inclusion_criteria`;
      if a cohort is declared `user-defined` `cohort_inclusion_criteria` could be
      automatically populated from the parameters used to perform the query.
    type: string
    enum:
      - study-defined
      - beacon-defined
      - user-defined
    default: beacon-defined
  cohortDesign:
    description: >-
      Cohort type by its design. A plan specification comprised of protocols
      (which may specify how and what kinds of data will be gathered) that are executed
      as part of an investigation and is realized during a study design execution.
      Value from Ontologized MIABIS (OMIABIS) Study design ontology term tree (OBI:0500000).

    description: >-
      Cohort identifier. For `study-defined` or `beacon-defined` cohorts
      this field is set by the implementer. For `user-defined` this unique identifier
      could be generated upon the query that defined the cohort, but could be later
      edited by the user.

      - cohort-T2D-2010
  name:
    description: >-
      Name of the cohort. For `user-defined` this field could be generated
      upon the query, e.g. a value that is a concatenationor some representation of
      the user query.
