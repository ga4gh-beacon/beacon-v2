  cohortType:
    description: Cohort type by its definition. If a cohort is declared ´study-defined´
      or ´beacon-defined´ criteria are to be entered in cohort_inclusion_criteria;
      if a cohort is declared ‘user-defined' cohort_inclusion_criteria could be automatically
      populated from the parameters used to perform the query.
    type: string
    enum:
      - study-defined
      - beacon-defined
      - user-defined
    default: beacon-defined
  cohortDesign:
    description: Cohort type by its design. A plan specification comprised of protocols
      (which may specify how and what kinds of data will be gathered) that are executed
      as part of an investigation and is realized during a study design execution.
      Value from Ontologized MIABIS (OMIABIS) Study design ontology term tree (OBI:0500000).
