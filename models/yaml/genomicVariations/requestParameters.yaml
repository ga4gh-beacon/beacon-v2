        \ allele at position\n      `start` or in the `startMin` => `startMax` interval,\

      description: Minimum length in bases of a genomic variant. This is an optional

        structural variants such as copy number variations, it is recommended that
        length based queries should also be supported for variants with indicated
        referenceBases and alternateBases, to enable length-specific wildcard queries.
