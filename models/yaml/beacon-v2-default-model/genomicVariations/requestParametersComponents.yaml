  Assembly:
    description: Genomic assembly accession and version as RefSqeq assembly accession
      (e.g. "GCF_000001405.39") or a versioned assembly name or synonym such as UCSC
      Genome Browser assembly (e.g. "hg38") or Genome Reference Consortium Human (e.g.
      "GRCh38.p13") names.
    type: string
    example:
      - GCF_000001405.39
      - hg38
      - GRCh38.p13
  RefSeqId:
    description: Reference sequence id for genomic reference sequence in which variant
      coordinates are given, e.g. "NC_000009" for human chromosome 9. Preferably the
      RefSeqId, alternatively, names, synonymous or aliases e.g. "Chr9" could be used.
    type: string
    example:
      - NC_000009
      - Chr9
      - NC_012920.1
  ReferenceBases:
    description: 'Reference bases for this variant (starting from `start`). * Accepted
      values: [ACGTN]*. * N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of any base,
      and can be used as a standalone base of any type or within a partially known
      sequence. As example, a query of `ANNT` the Ns can take take any form of [ACGT]
      and will match `ANNT`, `ACNT`, `ACCT`, `ACGT` ... and so forth. * an *empty
      value* is used in the case of insertions with the maximally trimmed, inserted
      sequence being indicated in `AlternateBases`'
    type: string
    pattern: ^([ACGTUNRYSWKMBDHV\-\.]*)$
  AlternateBases:
    description: "Alternate bases for this variant (starting from `start`).\n* Accepted\
      \ values: [ACGTN]*.\n* N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of any base,\
      \ and can be\nused as a standalone base of any type or within a partially known\n\
      sequence. As example, a query of `ANNT` the Ns can take take any form of\n[ACGT]\
      \ and will match `ANNT`, `ACNT`, `ACCT`, `ACGT` ... and so forth.\n* an *empty\
      \ value* is used in the case of deletions with the maximally\ntrimmed, deleted\
      \ sequence being indicated in `ReferenceBases`\n* Categorical variant queries,\
      \ e.g. such *not* being represented through\nsequence & position, make use of\
      \ the `variantType` parameter.\n* either `alternateBases` or `variantType` is\
      \ required."
