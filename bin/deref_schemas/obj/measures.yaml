            before ovulation and approximately 3 weeks before implantation of the
            blastocyst. Because most women know when their last period began but not

              description: 'Gestational age (or menstrual age) is the time elapsed
                between the first day of the last normal menstrual period and the
                day of delivery. The first day of the last menstrual period occurs
                approximately 2 weeks before ovulation and approximately 3 weeks before
                implantation of the blastocyst. Because most women know when their
                last period began but not when ovulation occurred, this definition
                traditionally has been used when estimating the expected date of delivery.
                In contrast, chronological age (or postnatal age) is the time elapsed
                after birth. Provenance: Phenopackets v2'
