# How to Contribute to Beacon Development

The Beacon API & standard is a driver project of the Global Alliance for Genomics
and Health [**GA4GH**](https://ga4gh.org). Since 2016 Beacon development has been 
organized through projects supported by ELIXIR with additional contributions from
outside organizations and individual developers and implementers.
