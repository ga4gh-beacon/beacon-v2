| referenceBases | Reference bases for this variant (starting from `start`). * Accepted values: IUPAC codes for nucleotides (e.g. `https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html`). N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of any base, and can be used as a standalone base of any type or within a partially known sequence. As example, a query of `ANNT` the Ns can take take any form of `[ACGT]` and will match `ANNT`, `ACNT`, `ACCT`, `ACGT` ... and so forth. * an *empty value* is used in the case of insertions with the maximally trimmed, inserted sequence being indicated in `AlternateBases`. NOTE: Many Beacon instances could not support UIPAC codes and it is not mandatory for them to do so. In such cases the use of [ACGTN] is mandated. | string | NA | A, T, N, , ACG | NA|
