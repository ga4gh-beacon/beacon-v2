| variantType | The `variantType` declares the nature of the variation in relation to a reference. In a response, it is used to describe the variation. Examples here are e.g. structural variants such as `DUP` (increased allelic count of material from the genomic region  between `start` and `end` positions without assumption about the placement of the additional sequence) or `DEL` (deletion of sequence following `start`). Either `alternateBases` or `variantType` is required in representing a `LegacyVariation`. | string | NA | SNP, DEL, DUP, BND | NA|
