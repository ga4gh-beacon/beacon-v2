| variantType | The `variantType` declares the nature of the variation in relation to a reference. In a response, it is used to describe the variation. In a request, it is used to declare the type of event the Beacon client is looking for. If in queries variants can not be defined through a sequence of one or more bases (`precise` variants) it can be used standalone (i.e. without `alternateBases`) together with positional parameters. Examples here are e.g. queries for structural variants such as `DUP` (increased allelic count of material from the genomic region  between `start` and `end` positions without assumption about the placement of the additional sequence) or `DEL` (deletion of sequence following `start`). Either `alternateBases` or `variantType` is required, with the exception of range queries (single `start` and `end` parameters). | string | NA | SNP, DEL, DUP, BND | NA|
