# Welcome to the Beacon v2 Documentation

!!! Important "Under Development"

	Note that Beacon v2 is still [under development](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2-Models) and needs to be approved by the [GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/).

The core documentation (i.e. this document) can be found on [here](https://beacon-project.io/beacon-v2/).

## Scope and Purpose

With growing interest from the community in the implementation of the Beacon protocol into resources and workflows, the major 2.0 release scheduled for Spring 2022 will introduce new features which were considered important by the community such as:

* extended and clearer specified genomic variation queries, including wildcard and region queries (i.e. returning variants within a genomic/chromosomal region)
* get a list of samples related to a phenotype, provided the required authentication or authorization
* powerful _filters_, primarily based on CURIE terms for ontologies and references, including options to control the use of hierarchical terms or the precision of term matching
* scoped data delivery (e.g. matched variant details or sample information) as part of Beacon responses or through _handover_ protocols
