# Beacon "Flavours"

!!! Note "About UI"
    Most of the information that you will find here is related to the [Beacon v2 specification](/). For that reason, the examples are shown as REST API requests/responses in the form of [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). If you are only interested in using beacon with a **graphical interface** please visit the [implementations](implementations-options.md) page.

While the original Beacon v1 only provided Boolean (_i.e._ **YES/NO**) responses
on queries for the existence of specific genomic variants, Beacon v2 is a flexible
protocol that supports different usage scenarios - also called "flavours", since
they are more a representation of usage types w/o prescribing their specific details.

Importantly, the Beacon framework separates query options from the response side. In that way
a privacy-protecting[^1] Boolean Beacon still may offer more query features - and therefore better
usability - compared to the first Beacon concept implementations.

!!! Important "Technical Notes"

	For detailed information about the technical implementation of the different logical
	scopes please see the [Framework](framework.md) documentation.

## Aggregate Response Beacons - Boolean and Count

A _Boolean Response_ Beacon is in it's response similar to Beacon v1 - _i.e._ responding
with a _true_ or _false_ value when queried for the existence of some data in a resource. Similarly
a _Count Response_ Beacon only returns aggregate information, _i.e._ the number of matched
entries (e.g. genomic variants), a feature also part of the Beacon v1 protocol.

However, in contrast to earlier versions, in Beacon v2 _in principle_ a beaconized resource
may implement all types of query options (e.g. combinations of various filters and
genomic query parameters) but still only offer a Boolean and optionally Count response.

Also, all Beacons _should_ implement the _Boolean Response_ format as fallback option and
handle extended options depending on the user's authentication status.

## Beacons Supporting Data and Information Delivery

!!! Important "Technical Notes"

	For detailed information about the technical implementation of the different logical
	scopes please see the [Models](models.md) documentation.

Information about the different data delivery options can be found here:

* data delivery using [Model defined records](/records/)
* file and information linking using [handover objects](/handovers/)
